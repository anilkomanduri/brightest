<h1>What is the BrighTest API?<a name="BrighTestAPI"></h1>

<h1>How to add new commands?<a name="CmdExtension"></h1>
<pre>
BrighTest supports a command discovery mechanism. This allows for any methods in a class in a magic package to be exposed as selenium commands.
The magic package can be also passed as a system property using brightest.discovery.package key. By default any class in com.imaginea.brightest.extension is used as a command handler.
All methods annotated with com.imaginea.brightest.execution.CommandInfo annotation are treated as commands.

Commands could either assert or do UI interactions.  assert methods should return a boolean flag, the framework automatically raises a ComparisonFailure exception if the return value is false.
UI Interaction commands can be void. Their return value is ignored. The methods must follow the following signature
public <return type, void for interaction and boolean for assert> <methodName>(ExecutionContext context, Command command) 


Both command types have access to Execution Context, which allows them to access selenium.

<h1>How to externalize locators and properties and support internationalization?<a name="Externalization"></h1>
<pre>
BrighTest supports properties file. There can be one or multiple properties file. The order in which they are passed to BrighTest defines the overriding. For example if there are
two properties file, both containing the key "loginBtn.locator", the property file mentioned first will override the second property file. The keys defined in property files can 
be used for locators or optional args in the commands.  They have to be surrounded with "${}", for example the normal command "click loginBtn.locator" would need to be 
written as "click ${loginBtn.locator}". Like locators the optional argument which is used to pass values can also be externalized to a properties file. The framework resolves the 
command parameters when it sees the ${} mark.
