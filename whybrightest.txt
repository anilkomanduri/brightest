Selenium IDE supports
LocatorBuilders.order = ['id', 'link', 'name', 'dom:name', 'xpath:link', 'xpath:img', 'xpath:attributes', 'xpath:href', 'dom:index', 'xpath:position'];
whereas the java driver with backport support for selenium supports xpath, css and //. It does have support for additional properties via sizzle, but the client would need  a translation layer to support the same.
